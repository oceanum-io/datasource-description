## Dataset description

The Red Sea wave hindcast dataset provides a detailed account of ocean wave parameters across the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Arabian Sea (Figure 1). The domain encompasses the entire Red Sea from the Gulf of Suez and Gulf of Aqaba in the north to the Bab el-Mandeb strait in the south, extending eastward through the Gulf of Aden to the Arabian Sea. Wave spectra are computed over a 45+ year period between 1979 and present using the SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) third-generation spectral wave model. The model is driven by inputs from the Oceanum Global Wave Model for spectral boundaries and <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5" target="_blank">ERA5 reanalysis winds</a> from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The hindcast is calibrated against the satellite altimeter dataset of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0083-9" target="_blank">Ribal and Young (2019)</a>. Bathymetry is derived from the <a href="https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/" target="_blank">GEBCO 2023</a> global bathymetric grid.

The modelling setup employs the <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/29/9/jtech-d-11-00092_1.xml" target="_blank">ST6</a> source term parameterisations. Spectra are discretised into 36 directional bins and 36 frequency bins, covering a frequency range from 0.037 to 1.04 Hz with 10% logarithmic increments. The model features a regular grid with a 5 km (0.05 degree) resolution, spanning the entire Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region.

The dataset provides hourly estimates for an extensive array of ocean wave parameters (Table 2) including spectral quantities integrated over the full spectrum and for spectral partitions. Partitions are defined from an 8-second split (sea/swell) and from the Watershed method, which identifies one wind-forced partition and up to three swell partitions. These data are stored over the entire grid at native resolution. Additionally, frequency-direction wave spectra are available at 1026 sites distributed across the domain (see Figure 1).

## Validation

The wave hindcast can be validated against satellite altimeter observations using the <a href="https://hindcast-satellite-validation-main-prod.apps.oceanum.io/" target="_blank">Oceanum Hindcast Satellite Validation App</a>. This interactive tool allows users to compare modelled significant wave height against satellite altimeter measurements at any location within the model domain, providing density scatter plots, quantile comparisons, and statistical metrics.
